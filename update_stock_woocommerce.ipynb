    "# Updating stock in Woocommerce from Edisoft with Python"
   ]
  },

   "source": [
    "This Python script is designed to update the stock in a web store using the WooCommerce REST API. The script takes stock data from a program called Edisoft and compares it with the stock data in the web store. If there are any differences, the script updates the stock in the web store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the script step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The necessary libraries are imported, including pandas, numpy, re, woocommerce, smtplib, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parameter values are set, including the location of the stock files, email parameters, and WooCommerce parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script defines a function called **`enviar_email`** which is responsible for sending an email using SMTP with the given information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A decorator function called **`log_exception`** is defined. This decorator logs any exceptions raised by a given function and sends an email with the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The **`file_clean`** function is defined to eliminate rows that are not inventory lines in a file. It uses a regular expression pattern to filter out non-inventory lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The **`select_inventory`** function is defined to select the most recent file starting with \"I20\" within a specified folder. It compares the most recent file with the second most recent file and continues if there is a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The **`import_clean_inventory`** function is defined to import and clean an Edisoft inventory dataset. It reads the dataset file, extracts information from columns based on fixed positions, converts stock and price columns to appropriate data types, removes duplicates based on ISBN, and returns the cleaned dataset as a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The **`import_inventary_web`** function is defined to import the inventory from a WooCommerce webshop using the WooCommerce REST API. It creates a WooCommerce API object, downloads products from the webshop, transforms them into a DataFrame, removes duplicates based on product ID, and returns the imported inventory as a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The **`web_edisoft_join`** function is defined to select items with different stock between the web store inventory and the Edisoft inventory. It joins the two DataFrames based on SKU and ISBN columns, identifies the items with different stock, and returns a filtered DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The **`stock_update_batch`** function is defined to update the stock of the web store using the WooCommerce REST API and verify the update. It creates a WooCommerce API object, divides the inventory DataFrame into batches to avoid exceeding the connection time, updates the stock using the API, and checks if the updated items have been properly updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The script calls the functions in the following sequence:\n",
    "   a. **`import_clean_inventory`** function to import and clean the Edisoft inventory dataset.\n",
    "   b. **`import_inventary_web`** function to import the inventory from the web store.\n",
    "   c. **`web_edisoft_join`** function to select items with different stock between the web store and Edisoft inventories.\n",
    "   d. **`stock_update_batch`** function to update the stock in the web store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script automates the process of updating the stock in a web store by comparing it with the stock data from Edisoft and using the WooCommerce REST API to make the necessary updates. It also handles exceptions and sends email notifications in case of errors."

    "The **`log_exception`** function is a decorator that can be applied to other functions in order to log any exceptions that occur during their execution. It performs the following steps:\n",

    "1. Decorator Setup: The **`@wraps(func)`** decorator ensures that the wrapper function maintains the same name and documentation as the original function being decorated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Wrapper Function: The **`wrapper`** function is defined within the**`log_exception`** function. This function serves as a wrapper around the decorated function.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Logging: If an exception is caught, the function proceeds to log the error message in a CSV file. The **`log_file`** variable stores the name of the CSV file (\"log_update_stock.csv\"). The **`error_message`** variable is created, which includes the details of the error message and the name of the function where the exception occurred. The error message is appended to the CSV file using the **`csv.writer`** object.\n",

    "By using the **`log_exception`** decorator on a function, any exceptions that occur during the execution of that function will be caught, logged to a CSV file, and an email notification will be sent. This helps in tracking and analyzing the errors that occur during the execution of the decorated function."

    "This script is used to import the inventory from a WooCommerce webshop using the WooCommerce REST API. Let's go through the script step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function **`import_inventory_web`** is defined with four parameters: **`url`, **`consumer_key`**, **`consumer_secret`**, and **`timeout`**. These parameters are used to establish a connection with the WooCommerce webshop and retrieve the inventory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function has a docstring that provides information about the purpose of the function, its arguments, return value, and examples of how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script starts by creating an API object (**`wcapi`**) using the provided URL, consumer key, consumer secret, and timeout values. This object allows interaction with the WooCommerce REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Products are downloaded from the webshop in batches of 100 products per page. The script initializes an empty dictionary (`pags_products`) to store the product data from each page. It then enters a while loop to fetch products from each page incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inside the loop, the script makes a GET request to the WooCommerce API endpoint for retrieving products. The **`params`** argument is used to specify the number of products per page (**`per_page`**) and the current page number (**`page`**). The response is stored in the **`response`** variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The response is converted to JSON format using the **`json()`** method, and the resulting JSON data is stored in the **`products`** variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If there are no more products in the response (i.e., **`products`** is empty), the loop is exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The script then normalizes the product JSON data into a pandas DataFrame (`df`) using **`pd.json_normalize(products)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The DataFrame for the current page is added to the **`pags_products`** dictionary with a key representing the page number.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The page number is incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. After all pages have been processed, the script concatenates all the DataFrames in **`pags_products`** into a single DataFrame (**`web_all_df`**) using **`pd.concat`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. From the combined DataFrame, only specific columns (**`id`**, **`sku`, **`name`, **`stock_quantity`) are selected and stored in the **`web_df`** DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The script prints the downloaded inventory data (**`web_df`**) and a line of dashes for visual separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Duplicate products based on the **`id`** column are searched for in **`web_df`**, and any duplicates found are removed using the **`drop_duplicates`** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. The script prints whether duplicates are present in the cleaned **`web_df`** DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",

    "The function **`stock_update_batch`** is responsible for updating the stock of a web store using the WooCommerce REST API and verifying if the update has been performed correctly. Here's a breakdown of what the function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It takes several parameters: **`df`** (a Pandas DataFrame containing the stock data to be updated), **`url`** (the URL of the WooCommerce web store), **`consumer_key`** and **`consumer_secret`** (authentication credentials for the REST API), and **`timeout`** (the request timeout in seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An API object (**`wcapi`**) is created using the provided URL, consumer key, consumer secret, and timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function converts the DataFrame (**`df`**) into a dictionary (**`df_dict`**). It then randomly selects a sample of items from the dictionary for checking the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The DataFrame is split into batches to avoid exceeding the connection time. Each batch is used to create a dictionary (**`stock_to_update`**) that is passed to the WooCommerce API's **`put`** method, which updates the stock of the web store.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After the update, the function checks if the updated items have been properly updated. It retrieves the product information from the API using the product IDs from the randomly selected items. The retrieved information is converted into a DataFrame (**`product_df`**), and the stock quantity is compared with the expected stock quantity from **`df_dict`**. If a mismatch is found, an error message is printed, and the item is recorded in a log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, the function writes a summary of the update to the log file and sends an email notification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that there are a few missing parts in the code, such as the definition of the **`API`** class and the **`enviar_email`** function, which are referenced but not provided in the code. You will need to ensure that these parts are correctly defined and imported for the script to work as intended."
